# TRACE4PM - discovery

This project is part of the [TRACE4PM stack](https://github.com/TRACE4PM) and is intended to be used with the TRACE4PM API.


### Fonctionnement du discover 

This service implements several algorithms for process discovery from log files using the **PM4PY** package.  
The algorithms can handle files in `.csv` or `.xes` format. Each algorithm has two functions. For example, with the Alpha Miner algorithm, there is the `alpha_miner_algo` function, which generates a **Petri Net model** and saves it as a PNG file in a temporary folder. 

The second function is used to assess the quality of the generated model by calculating the following metrics: **fitness**, **precision**, **generalization**, and **simplicity**. This function returns a ZIP file that contains: 
- A PNG of the model generated by the algorithm
- A JSON file containing the calculated quality metrics
- A PNML file

Regarding the calculation of **fitness** and **precision**, two approaches are available: 
- Token-based 
- Alignment-based

Additionally, this service implements a function called `process_animate`, which produces an animation of the log file using the `processanimateR` library from the **BupaR** package. This requires an R environment with the necessary libraries installed.
